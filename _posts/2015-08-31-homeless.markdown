Many homeless people roam our streets today—not because
they want to—but
because they have no choice.
Not everybody is given a privileged life.
Some are not even given the chance to get a good education,all the more a decent job to survive the hardships of life.

Every man has a story.
Some of them might even keep their stories to themselves, but let us not judge them for what we see on the surface.
Many homeless people are considered a nuisance, especially by those who are not directly concerned.
When some of us see a homeless person dressed as this person in the video, our usual initial reaction is to move away.
They are people too, they just don’t have the means to feed and support themselves at the moment.
